# Jyothis Chandran

I am Jyothis, a PhD student in Observational Cosmology at [IFCA](https://ifca.unican.es/es-es). My study is funded by a pre-doctoral contract under the "CONCEPCION ARENAL" program of the [Universidad de Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/). I have been working under the supervision of [Mathieu Remazeilles](https://ifca-cosmology.github.io/remazeillesm) and [Rita Bel√©n Barreiro](https://ifca-cosmology.github.io/barreirorb) from February 2024. While completing my Integrated Bachelor of Science - Master of Science (BS-MS) degree at [IISER Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/), majoring in Physics and minoring in Mathematics, my thesis was focused on characterising and reducing residual and noise bias in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observation from [PLANCK](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck) and [WMAP](https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/) multi-frequency data using Harmonic ILC. I also briefly worked on understanding modified gravity (Horndeski theories) using parameters like the gravitational slip.

During my ongoing PhD, my work focuses on the "component separation" problem, specifically in the context of CMB observations and other related signals, particularly using blind component separation methods such as NILC. We produced the current best public all-sky Compton y-parameter map (y-map) of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect using Planck NPIPE data. Further work is being done to provide y-maps with reduced contamination from other foreground and background components. My interests also include characterising and producing cleaned maps of other components like the Synchrotron, free-free, CIB, etc.; constraining cosmological parameters using CMB and thermal SZ observations; mapping relativistic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects to improve the understanding of matter distribution in galaxy clusters; and understanding different forms of CMB spectral distortions seeded in the pre-recombination era.
