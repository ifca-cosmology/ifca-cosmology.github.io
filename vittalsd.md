# Dheeraj Vittal Shenoy

I'm Dheeraj, PhD researcher at [Instituto de Física de Cantabria (IFCA, CSIC-UC)](https://ifca.unican.es/en-us) in **Santander, Spain** working at the intersection of machine learning and cosmology. My doctoral work focuses on the cosmic microwave background (CMB), with particular emphasis on developing advanced methods for foreground separation and signal reconstruction. By combining statistical techniques with modern machine learning approaches, I aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of CMB analysis, helping to isolate the primordial cosmological signal from complex astrophysical contaminants.

*Some more information about me* : I completed my master’s degree in Physics at Jain University, Bengaluru, India. I carried out my Masters thesis and research internship at the [Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru, India](https://www.iiap.res.in/), where I worked on solar physics studying Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).
