# Airam Marcos Caballero


I am a cosmologist specializing in the study of primordial perturbations, CMB anisotropies, and early-Universe physics. I completed my PhD at the Instituto de Física de Cantabria (IFCA), where I worked on large-scale CMB perturbations and peak theory, and later held a postdoctoral position at the University of the Basque Country applying peak theory to primordial black hole formation. 

I have contributed to major international collaborations, including Planck, J-PAS, LiteBIRD, and QUIJOTE, where my work spans theoretical modeling, instrument design, calibration, simulation, and forecasting for next-generation CMB polarization experiments. My research aims to deepen our understanding of the inflationary Universe and its observable signatures through precise cosmological measurements.
