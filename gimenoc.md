# NAME


I am Christian, a former PhD student in cosmology and currently working within the RadioForegroundsPlus and LiteBIRD collaborations. My current activities span several projects, ranging from the construction of a radio-source catalog using RadioForegroundsPlus data to studies of half-wave plate systematics—particularly intensity-to-polarization (I→P) leakage—and their impact on the calibration of polarization angles for LiteBIRD.

I obtained my PhD in October 2025 from the Instituto de Física de Cantabria (IFCA), Spain, where I began my doctoral studies in September 2021 under the supervision of Enrique Martínez-González and Belén Barreiro, supported by an FPI grant from the Spanish National Research Council. My research focused on testing the statistical isotropy of the Universe using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, with a particular emphasis on CMB anomalies.
