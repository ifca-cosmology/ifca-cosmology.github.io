# Master Seminars
Seminars part of the [Master in Particle Physics and Physics of the Cosmos](https://masterphyparcos.ifca.es/) of the University of Cantabria and International University Menéndez Pelayo, coordinated by IFCA. Broader topics and treated at an introductory level. We only list here those related with cosmology. Click on the talk title for abstract and further details.

  <summary>06/02/2026, Black hole echoes and boundary effective field theory (Subodh Patil, Leiden University)</summary>
	12:00, 06/02/2026 - Sala de Claustros
	<br>
	<i>Abstract</i>: The idea that black holes may not have purely infalling boundary conditions at the horizon has a range of theoretical and phenomenological motivations. The inevitable result is that any post-merger ringdown will exhibit echoes. Given the fact that boundary conditions in any field theory can be implemented via a so-called boundary effective action, we first offer a pedagogical review of the reformulation of the problem in terms of a stretched horizon effective field theory. Doing so allows us to specify what is strictly observable, and relate so-called reflection coefficients directly to the scales associated with various boundary operators. This allows us to quantify the deformation of GR required near the horizon to produce such echoes (and whether one finds this plausible). We also find an unavoidable feature: an induced mode dependence for the reflection coefficients that traces to the non-locality of the boundary action generated under RG flow. In order to demystify the physics of non-local boundary effective actions, we show that the same thing happens in electrostatics (!) which also allows us to distill features specific to horizons. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings can inform future searches, and how a putative no-go theorem for the black hole echoes is evaded. N.B. The work presented in this talk was done in collaboration with a number of master's students at Leiden, and a number of interesting topics for master's research projects will be summarized at the end of this talk.

  <summary>13/02/2026, Cosmology and Supernovae through Cosmic Lenses (Sherry Suyu, TUM)</summary>
  11:00, 13/02/2026 - Sala de Claustros
  <br>
	<i>Abstract</i>: Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) are emerging as a new probe of cosmology and SNe. When a SN is strongly lensed by a foreground galaxy, multiple images of the SN will appear around the foreground galaxy at different times. Current and upcoming surveys including Euclid and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time will capture hundreds of strongly lensed SNe, expanding the existing sample by two orders of magnitude. These events offer excellent opportunities to: (1) measure the Hubble constant via lensing time delays, shedding light on the Hubble tension, and (2) obtain unprecedented constraints on SN progenitors through early-phase spectra. I will give an overview of the first discoveries of lensed SNe and their cosmological implications.
