# Patricio Vielva


Patricio vielva is a CSIC Research Scientist at the Instituto de Física de Cantabria (IFCA, CSIC–University of Cantabria), specializing in observational cosmology, with a particular focus on the study of the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the Universe, as well as their interrelation. His research centers on data analysis and the development and application of advanced image-processing techniques and statistical methods, being a pioneer in the application of wavelet-based methods in this field. He has carried out his work within major international scientific collaborations, starting with the ESA Planck mission, and is a member of the QUIJOTE and LiteBIRD experiments, as well as key initiatives and projects such as ELFS, J-PAS, SKAO/ASKAP, and ARRAKIHS, the first Spanish-led mission within ESA’s Science Programme, aimed at studying the properties and nature of dark matter. He has participated in 31 research projects with a total budget of approximately €12 million, serving as principal investigator in eight of them. He has extensive experience in scientific leadership, dissemination, and training, with more than 70 oral contributions, around 20 invited talks at conferences, about 30 proceedings publications, and a strong record in the organization of scientific meetings. He has supervised numerous PhD, Master’s, and undergraduate students, has served as director of a university Master’s program, and actively contributes as an evaluator and referee for international research programs and scientific journals. His publications can be consulted at [Orcid ](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0051-272X).
