The interests of the members of the Cosmology Group at IFCA cover a wide variety of topics in cosmology. Since there is a strong emphasis of the group on observational cosmology, we also contribute to many [collaborations, missions and international projects]({{site.url}}/collabs) related with these research lines. You can find some more details about our research interests below.

The Cosmic Microwave Background is the oldest light in the Universe, a relic from about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Its discovery and precise measurement have transformed cosmology, providing a cornerstone for the standard model of the Universe. Studies of the CMB have revealed its near-perfect blackbody spectrum, tiny temperature anisotropies, and polarization patterns, which encode information about the Universe’s composition, geometry, and evolution. Our research focuses on extracting this information with increasing precision. Past missions such as COBE, WMAP, and Planck established the ΛCDM model and measured key parameters like the age, curvature, and matter content of the Universe. Today, the major goals are even more ambitious: detecting the faint B-mode polarization signal from primordial gravitational waves, constraining inflationary models, and probing physics beyond the Standard Model.

In addition to anisotropies and polarization, spectral distortions of the CMB spectrum offer a new window into the thermal history of the Universe. These distortions can reveal energy release from early processes such as particle decays, primordial black holes, or small-scale structure formation, providing complementary constraints on fundamental physics. We also explore secondary effects imprinted on the CMB, such as gravitational lensing and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, which trace the distribution of matter and hot gas on large scales. These measurements help us understand the formation of cosmic structure, the role of dark matter and dark energy, and the properties of neutrinos. 

This research line combines theoretical modeling, data analysis, and participation in leading international experiments, ensuring a lasting impact on cosmology and astrophysics.

## Dark Matter

The nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of modern physics. The group is involved in a number of initiatives to shed light on the nature of Dark Matter, across scales from the cosmological to the microscopic. Studies of the CMB  and large scale structure allow us to constrain the total abundance and distribution of DM in our Universe, while we also explore how the interactions of DM may show up in cosmological observables. 

With gravitational lensing we can map out the distribution of DM in galaxy clusters, allowing us to search for DM substructures, and providing us with a means of distinguishing between particle DM, wave-like DM or DM in the form of compact objects such as primordial black holes. We have also made important contributions to the use of gravitational waves as probe of dark matter on small scales, a field that will reach maturity with the Einstein Telescope. 

On the scale of galaxies, the properties of DM may affect the nature and number of substructures such as streams and satellite galaxies. Our group leads the ARRAKIHS mission, a planned space telescope which will image nearby low-surface brightness galaxies at unprecedented sensitivity to provide the definitive test of the nature of DM. 

In collaboration with the high energy physics group, the cosmology group also contributes to direct searches for Dark Matter in the lab, including the DAMIC-M experiment, which searches for DM using low-background Charged Coupled Deviced (CCDs) as sensitive ionisation detectors. IFCA also contributes to the development of CADEx, a next generation search for dark matter axions at W-band frequencies. 

These observational and experimental probes of DM are complemented by phenomenological studies to understand how possible signals of DM may show up in these experiments and what we may learn about DM if it does.

## Gravitational Lensing

<p style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0 0 0;">

Gravitational lensing is produced by the warping of space-time around massive structures. The group specialises in gravitational lensing around the most massive structures in the universe, Galaxy Clusters. We take advantage of the best observatories on Earth (actually in orbit around Earth and at Lagrange point L2), namely the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) where we have secured over 500 hours of observing time together with our collaborators. The group has developed its own techniques and algorithms to reconstruct the distribution of matter (mostly dark matter) in galaxy clusters using the gravitational lensing effect. In addition, we use this effect to constrain the cosmological model via the difference time of arrival of the light from different counterimages (or time delays) of the same background object, usually a quasar or a supernova. The gravitational lensing group at IFCA has used time delays to constrain the expansion rate of the universe, of Hubble constant, through this technique. 

The next years will witness a rapid evolution in this field as new data from JWST, Euclid and Rubin will provide tens of new time delay measurements which will be used to reach a competitive percent-level precision in the measurement of the Hubble constant with this technique. The group at IFCA is also making leading contributions in the are of microlensing of distant stars (z>0.5), and has contributed to the discovery of most of the lensed stars beyond z=0.5 known to date (Icarus, Warhol, Spock, Quyllur, Godzilla, Mothra, Earendel, Hedorah, …). Our group uses changes in the observed light from these stars to trace small perturbations in the distribution of dark matter. 

Within Euclid we are involved with the analysis of new gravitational lenses (both on galactic scales and galaxy clyster scales). We are also involved with other ongoing surveys such as the Spanish lead J-PAS that wll discover new galaxy clusters and will play a crucial role at identifying members of the clysters given the high-quality photometric redshifts obtained by J-PAS.

## Line-Intensity Mapping

<p style="text-align:center; margin: 0 0 0 0;">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/imgs/Lines/lim.jpg"
       style="max-width:100%; height:auto; width:750px;">
</p>

Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is a technique that employs low-aperture instruments to quickly scan the sky and collect all the incoming radiation, targetting identifiable spectral lines to recover radial information through good experimental spectral resolution. Since it does not requires to resolve individual sources, LIM provides access to redshifts well beyond the reach of galaxy surveys and is also sensitive to the population of faint sources that are hard to resolve individually. This provides direct access to epochs of the history of the Universe and regimes that are inaccessible otherwise.

Since overall fluxes are measured, LIM is both sensitive to the large-scale matter distribution and the astrophysical processes that drive the emission of each line in atomic and molecular gas clouds within and around galaxies. Thus, targetting several spectral lines provides a more complete picture of the interstellar and intergalactic media. In summary, studying intensity fluctuations with LIM promises to deepen our understanding of various questions related to galaxy formation and evolution, cosmology, and fundamental physics, while being complementary to other techniques and cosmological probes. Unfortunately, the main benefits of LIM also come with the drawback of foreground contamination.

Besides general theoretical work improving the formalism  to measure summary statistics from the line-intensity maps and get a theoretical prediction and developing new science cases, we work on foreground mitigation in order to obtain clean observations free of foreground contaminants.
